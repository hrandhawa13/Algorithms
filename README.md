# Algorithms, Practise, Code Everyday 
This repositry contains all the problems solved from various websites like geeksforgeeks or freecodecamp.
The idea behind this repositry is that I stay connected with programming as I try to post a solution every day.
Main focus of problems would be algorithms, data structures and some random problems
